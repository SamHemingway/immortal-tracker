## Built with

- React
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion

## Features

- Track progress of every Legendary Lord in Total War: Warhammer 3.
- Search for lord/faction by text input.
- At a glance view of how many lords per faction you've completed, and their progress.
- Hover over a lord to preview their individual progress.
- No accounts/log-in required; everything is stored in local storage.

## Optimisation

- From the outset, I knew that this was going to be an image heavy app. As such, I optimised all images to be `.avif` format rather than `.png`. This resulted in reduced image sizes of up to 90%.
  - I felt comfortable committing to this image format as potential users for the app would be gamers, who generally use modern web browsers with support for this image format.
- The entire database of races/factions is not stored in local storage. Instead, we only store the factions/lords that the user has actually submitted progress for, and then interpret that progress onto the UI in the app when it is needed.
  - This will minimise the size of the local storage used by the app.
